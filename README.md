# Project for Advanced Machine Learning, UPV

In this project I've been working with fitting a gaussian mixture model using the regularized EM algorithm. Finally I've attempted to classify the MNIST data using this algorithm. 

- AML Joakim Olsen.pdf contains project report. 

- functions.py contains utility functions. 

- plotting.py contains all plotting functions. 

- tasks.py contains code to perform specified tasks. 

- MNIST.py contains code to use the algorithm to classify the MNIST data. 

- main.py decides which tasks to run. 


All tasks are run from main.
